By default, tmux isn't installed so run `brew install tmux` to install it.
Make sure `scripts/t` is executable (For the time being let's change it manually to follow along the course).
Also, uncomment the following line in ~/.zshrc -  
`
# If you come from bash you might have to change your $PATH.
export PATH=$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH
`
Install fzf using `brew install fzf`
