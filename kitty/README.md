To follow along with course [Neovim as a PHP and Javascript IDE](https://laracasts.com/series/neovim-as-a-php-ide), I've installed kitty. 
All the configuration of kitty copied from [Jess Archer's github](https://github.com/jessarcher/dotfiles/tree/master).

You need to install JetBrainsMono Nerd Font from [NerdFonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). We are using it in kitty.conf file.
Or, choose different one if you like other one.

Use brew to install nerd-fonts. You can find the fonts name from this [link](https://gist.github.com/davidteren/898f2dcccd42d9f8680ec69a3a5d350e).
Example: `brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font`

To install different theme, use command `kitty +kitten themes`. Currently 'One Dark' has been selected.
